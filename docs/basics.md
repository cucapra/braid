# The Basics

Braid has a tiny, imperative core language. You can assign to variables with `var`, do basic arithmetic, and define functions with `def`:

    var g = 9.8;
    def gpe(mass:Float, height:Float)
      mass * height * g;
    gpe(2.0, 3.0)

This program evaluates to around 58.8. (You can click on any of the examples in this document to run them in your browser.)

There's also an ML-esque syntax for defining and invoking functions, which can occasionally be more appropriate:

    var g = 9.8;
    var gpe = fun mass:Float height:Float -> mass * height * g;
    gpe 2.0 3.0

The language can also interoperate with JavaScript. Use `extern` to declare something from JavaScript land:

    extern Math.PI: Float;
    def circumference(radius:Float)
      2.0 * Math.PI * radius;
    circumference(5.0)
